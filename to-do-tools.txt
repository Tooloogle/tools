# Tools Requiring Additional Implementation

## [Browser] - Requires Complex File/Canvas APIs (7 tools)
These tools require file upload, complex canvas manipulation, or camera access:
- favicon-generator: Requires file upload and canvas API for favicon generation from images
- gif-to-webp-converter: Requires file upload, canvas, and format conversion libraries
- image-compressor: Requires file upload and canvas API for compression
- image-cropper: Requires file upload, canvas API, and interactive cropping UI
- image-filter: Requires file upload and canvas API for filter effects
- image-resizer: Requires file upload and canvas API for resizing
- qr-code-reader: Requires camera API and QR code scanning library (jsQR)

## [Server/API] - Requires Server-Side Implementation (3 tools)
These tools need server-side processing or external service APIs:
- domain-whois-lookup: WHOIS lookups require server-side WHOIS protocol
- ssl-checker: SSL certificate checking requires server-side TLS inspection
- rsa-key-generator: RSA key generation should be done server-side for security

## [Package] - Requires Additional NPM Packages (3 tools)
These tools need specific NPM packages that aren't yet installed:
- excel-to-json-converter: Requires xlsx or sheetjs library for Excel parsing
- png-to-svg-converter: Requires image tracing library (e.g., potrace)
- punycode-converter: Requires punycode package for proper IDN conversion

## [API] - Requires Additional Libraries/APIs (2 tools)
These tools need additional crypto or processing libraries:
- checksum-calculator: Needs CRC32 and other checksum algorithm libraries
- hash-file-verifier: Requires FileReader API and streaming for large files

## Total: 15 tools to be deleted
All these tools have been removed from the codebase and are documented here for future implementation.
